# PI-Novas-Vagas-Frontend (WIP)

## Future features

Subdomain for enterprise actions, informations and other things.

> the actual code is tightly coupled between applicant and enterprise pages.

SSR

> SPA (Single Page Application) it's better for an MVP (Minimium Viable Product), but SSR (Server Side Rendering) is more secure (I think).
