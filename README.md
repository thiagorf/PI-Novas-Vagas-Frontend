## Future features

Better ui/ux design coming soon.

> Figma reference will be provided in future releases.

Subdomain for enterprise actions, informations and other things.

> the actual code is tightly coupled between applicant and enterprise pages.

SSR

> SPA (Single Page Application) it's better for an MVP (Minimium Viable Product), but SSR (Server Side Rendering) is more secure (I think).
